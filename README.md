## What is Autism ?

Autism, also known as autism spectrum disorder, is a broad range of conditions that affect communication and behavior, usually appearing by age 2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that autism affects 1 in 54 children.

People with autism may have difficulty with communication and social interaction; restricted interests and repetitive behaviors; and inability to function effectively in school, work, and other areas of life.

## What Causes Autism?

Studies indicate the rate of autism is rising, but causes are not well-understood. Scientists have found rare gene changes, or mutations, as well as small common genetic variations in people with autism, implying a genetic component. A growing area of research focuses on interaction of genetic and environmental factors. For example, a woman’s exposure to harmful contaminants during pregnancy may trigger a genetic mutation leading to autism in her child. No link has been found between autism and vaccines, including those containing thimerosal, a mercury-based compound.

## What Environmental Factors May Be Associated With Autism ?

Progress has been made toward understanding different environmental risk factors, and the clearest evidence involves events before and during birth, such as:

Advanced parental age at time of conception
Prenatal exposure to air pollution or certain pesticides
Maternal obesity, diabetes, or immune system disorders
Extreme prematurity or very low birth weight
Any birth difficulty leading to periods of oxygen deprivation to the baby’s brain
The exact cause of ASD is unknown. The most current research demonstrates there’s no single cause.

## Some Suspected Risk factors for ASD include:

Having an immediate family member who’s autistic certain genetic mutations fragile X syndrome and other genetic disorders being born to older parents low birth weight metabolic imbalances exposure to heavy metals and environmental toxins a maternal history of viral infections fetal exposure to the medications valproic acid or thalidomide (Thalomid)

## An ASD diagnosis involves:

several screenings
genetic tests
evaluations

## What we are looking for ?

Connection between Age
Connection between Gender
Connection between an immediate family member has been diagnosed with autism
Specific Geographic location having maximum no. of Cases of Autism
Connection between Jaundice & Autism

## Columns

- ID - ID of the patient
- A1_Score to A10_Score - Score based on Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) 10 item screening tool | AQ-10 Questionnaire [Here](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg142/resources/autism-spectrum-quotient-aq10-test-pdf-186582493)

- age - Age of the patient in years
- gender - Gender of the patient
- ethnicity - Ethnicity of the patient
- jaundice - Whether the patient had jaundice at the time of birth
- autism - Whether an immediate family member has been diagnosed with autism
- contry_of_res - Country of residence of the patient
- used_app_before - Whether the patient has undergone a screening test before
- result - Score for AQ1-10 screening test
- age_desc - Age of the patient
- relation - Relation of patient who completed the test
- Class/ASD - Classified result as 0 or 1. Here 0 represents No and 1 - represents Yes. This is the target column, and during submission submit the values as 0 or 1 only.


## Key Findings
![Heading4](https://github.com/officialAmanchauhan/ML-Olympiad-Autism-Challenge/blob/main/Assets/4.png)

Patients having immediate family member has been diagnosed with Autism are more likely to have Autism
Patients having Jaundice are more likely to have Autism

![Heading8](https://github.com/officialAmanchauhan/ML-Olympiad-Autism-Challenge/blob/main/Assets/8.png)

The distribution of result for pacients without autism is pretty simetric, with mean close to 5. In the other way, most of the pacients with autism shows bigger result values.

## Code
Make a Jupiter Notebook or Google Colab and execute the following code:

- For EDA + Data Preprocessing: [Script1](https://github.com/officialAmanchauhan/ML-Olympiad-Autism-Challenge/blob/main/EDA%2BDataPreprocessing.ipynb)
- For Logistic Regression Model : [Script2](https://github.com/officialAmanchauhan/ML-Olympiad-Autism-Challenge/blob/main/Logistic_Regression_Model.ipynb)

## Future Work
- Improving Model Accuracy to 1.000
- Use of Other Machine Learning models
- Deployment of model as a website / portal to give predictions on individual cases
- What is the Root cause of Autism with thye help of data ?
